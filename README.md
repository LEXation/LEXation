The first computer programmer was a woman named **Ada Lovelace**. She worked on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. In 1843, she translated an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes, simply called "Notes". These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be processed by a machine. Ada's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on these capabilities. 🖥️💡
